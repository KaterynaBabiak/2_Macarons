            <div>
                <h3>Step 1</h3>
    
                <p>How to get almond flour:</p>
    
                <ol>
                    <li>In a store where they sell nuts, you can ask them to grind the nuts into flour (they do this in a coffee grinder).</li>
                    <li>Sift it</li>
                    <li>The almonds should be peeled if you are making white macarons.</li>
                    <li>If making chocolate macarons, you can use regular almonds.</li>
                </ol>
    
                <p>How to make flour for macarons:</p>
    
                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat the oven to 150 degrees.</li>
                    <li>Mix almond flour, powdered sugar, and cocoa in a food processor for 2 minutes. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper, pour the dry mixture onto the sheet, and dry it in the oven for 5 minutes. 
                        Sift through a very fine sieve.</li>
                </ol>

            <div>
                <h3>Step 2</h3>
    
                <ul>
                    <li>Whisk the egg whites, gradually adding granulated sugar until shiny. Add the dry mixture to the egg whites and gently mix from top to bottom.</li>
                    <li>The egg mixture will have a viscous consistency.</li>
                </ul>

            <div>
                <h3>Step 3</h3>
    
                <p>Prepare the ganache.</p>
    
                <ol>
                    <li>Heat the cream, add the broken pieces of chocolate.</li>
                    <li>Let it cool and refrigerate (preferably overnight).</li>
                    <li>Stir until fully dissolved.</li>
                </ol>
                <img src="" alt="thirdstep">
            </div>
    
            <div>
                <h3>Step 4</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Place the mixture into a pastry bag with a round nozzle and pipe small, evenly sized circles onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper.</li>
                    <li>Leave the baking sheet for 1 hour (I had a crust form in 30 minutes) at room temperature to form a crust.</li>
                </ol>
                <blockquote>
                    "This is very important; if the crust does not form, cracks will appear on the surface of the macarons during baking. You can check by touching the surface with your finger; if it doesn't stick, you can bake it."
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                    Bake in a preheated oven for 12 minutes, turning the baking sheet 180° after 6 minutes to ensure even baking.          
                </p>

                <h3>Step 5</h3>
    
                <ul>
                    <li>Remove the baking sheet from the oven and remove the parchment paper with the cookies.</li>
                    <li>Sprinkle cold water on the cookies, then return the parchment with the cookies back to the baking sheet.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Step 6</h3>
                <p>Assembly. Squeeze the filling from the pastry bag onto one half of the macaron and cover with the other half.</p>

            <h2>HOUSEKEEPING TIP</h2>
            <blockquote>
                “Macaron (French: Macaron) is a French confection made from egg whites, powdered sugar, granulated sugar, ground almonds, and food coloring. It is usually made in the shape of cookies; cream or jam is placed between two layers. The finished product is soft, with a smooth surface, and melts in the mouth. Macarons are sold in French McDonald’s; since 2010, these cookies have been known in the USA and Canada; their version is known in Japan.”
